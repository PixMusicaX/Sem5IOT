Note: Faculty suggests using [liveSQL](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=a9d0ddf772a14109JmltdHM9MTY5MDE1NjgwMCZpZ3VpZD0zM2RiODkyZi05NWM1LTZlYzUtMmZiOS05YTdhOTQ2ODZmMmQmaW5zaWQ9NTIyNQ&ptn=3&hsh=3&fclid=33db892f-95c5-6ec5-2fb9-9a7a94686f2d&psq=oraclelive&u=a1aHR0cHM6Ly9saXZlc3FsLm9yYWNsZS5jb20vYXBleC9mP3A9NTkwOjE3Ojc5ODMxMzcwOTU3NDg6Ojo6Og&ntb=1) over manual installation in device. Also note that liveSQL does not support most multiline commands 💢.

Note 2: <s>All Outputs should be handwritten (Printed outputs not allowed).</s> Apparently both printed and handwritten outputs are being accepted.

Note 3: You can use MySQL through XAMPP (refer to this [guide](/DBMS_LAB/guide.md)) since you'll be needing it for Software Lab anyway. If you prefer OracleSQL, then download it from this [link](https://www.appservgrid.com/coherence/downxe.html) and set it up.
